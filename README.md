Python and pygame was used to create Arctan(ks).
This game was built with the purpose of higher education. 
The objective of the project was to create a fun math-based game that is also educaational. 
The purpose of the game is to learn the different graphs of functions including polynomial, trigonemetric and linear functions through graphical representations of a tank.
Our plan is to create barriers that will force to make players use unique and creative functions to hit enemies so that each level cannot be solved with a simple linear function.
