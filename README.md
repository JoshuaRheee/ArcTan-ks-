Through the use of Python's library pygame, we created our game called Arctan(ks) during OwlHacks 2023.
This game was built with the purpose of higher education.
The objective of our project was to create a math-based game that is both fun and educaational.
The purpose of the game is to learn the different graphs of functions including polynomial, trigonemetric and linear functions.

Here is an old demo of ArcTan(ks):

A new demo featuring all of it's updates will be published soon (as of 3/22/2023)
